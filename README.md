# Predicting-Revenue-Generating-Customers-using-Google-Analytics-data
Capstone Project:
This Project would help to predict the revenue generating customers to help the marketing teams to invest appropriate budgets on promotional strategies

Key skills: EDA, Data Cleaning, Supervised Learning Classification, SMOTE Analysis, hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, Ensemble techniques.

# DataSet Source:

The dataset is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction.The data contains 903653 transactions and 55 features. Out of these 55 features, 12 are numerical and 43 are categorical(including binary).

# Resources Used:
Python Version: 3.7

Packages Used: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

# Model Building:

Used various classification models in order to find the best result in terms of accuracy and recall score.Random Forest classification model is providing better results in comparison to other models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNeighborsClassifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes and BaggingClassifier.

# Conclusion:

From this project the top prospective customers based on their revenue generating potential was identified. This enables the business to optimize their retargeting and remarketing strategies and eventually improve their Return on Investment
